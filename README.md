# BiblioManiac
‚ùìAbout:\
BIBLIO-MANIAC is an excessive fondness for acquiring and possessing books. Book Lovers know that there‚Äôs so much more to a book than just reading it. Do you love reading so much, you‚Äôve even tried to join a book club? Biblio-maniac is an app for all the book lovers out there who want to read as many books as possible so to make this easier Three‚Äôs Company came up with an innovative idea of building an online bookstore for all the biblio-maniacs out there but with a twist. The medium of buying and selling book is not in the form of money rather it works on BARTER SYSTEM. Bibliomaniacs on our app will exchange books in order to read more.

ü§îNeed of the App:\
The purpose was quite apparent, why should we stop our reading just because of the capital issue. It always is helpful to people of your kind; this app can help meet-up all the book lovers at a single platform where in you can know more about the different genres and enhance your knowledge with the people with more experience. You can filter out books according to the different categories to save your time and meet people who have same taste in reading as you. 

üòçBenefits:\
This idea was brought just for the sole purpose of maximising the reading efficiency without the thoughts of pricing issues in addition to reduction of environmental damage. Rather than selling books or keeping them just occupying space we can save our time, money and energy just by using an app. 

‚öôÔ∏èWorking of app:\
