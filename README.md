Do you love reading so much, you’ve even tried to join a book club? Biblio-maniac is an app for all the book lovers out there who want to read as many books as possible so to make this easier Three’s Company came up with an innovative idea of building an online bookstore for all the biblio-maniacs out there but with a twist. The medium of buying and selling book is not in the form of money rather it works on BARTER SYSTEM. Bibliomaniacs on our app will exchange books in order to read more.

You can filter out books according to the different categories to save your time and meet people who have same taste in reading as you. 

Benefits:\
This idea was brought just for the sole purpose of maximising the reading efficiency without the thoughts of pricing issues in addition to reduction of environmental damage. Rather than selling books or keeping them just occupying space we can save our time, money and energy just by using an app.
